# Mastering SQLite3 in Python: Creating Connections and Listing Tables Jupyter Notebook

# Introduction:

SQLite3, a lightweight and self-contained database engine, offers seamless integration with Python, making it an excellent choice for small to medium-sized projects. In this article, we will explore the essential techniques for working with SQLite3 in Python, focusing on two key aspects: listing tables and establishing a SQLite connection within the popular Jupyter Notebook environment. By mastering these skills, you'll unlock the power to efficiently manage and analyse data using SQLite3 in your Python projects.

We will be using Google Colaboratory for this article. Google Colaboratory, often known as Google Colab or Colab, is a cloud-based platform provided by Google that includes a Jupyter Notebook environment for building and running Python programmes.
